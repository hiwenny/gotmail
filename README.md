### Instructions
A frontend for custom email service.
To start with, install dependencies by running:
```
npm install
```

Then to start the server do:
```
npm start
```

To run unit tests:
```
npm test
```

The site is then accessible on `http://localhost:3000/`

Online version is available on `https://tranquil-shore-94410.herokuapp.com/`

Focus on improvement would be proper implementation of API integration as described in `src/utilities/messaging` and more thorough tests.
